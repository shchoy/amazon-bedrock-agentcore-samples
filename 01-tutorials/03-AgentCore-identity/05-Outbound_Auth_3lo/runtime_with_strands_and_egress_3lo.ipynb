    "# Outbound Auth\n",
    "\n",
    "Outbound Auth allows agents and the AgentCore Gateway to securely access AWS resources and third-party services on behalf of users who have been authenticated and authorized during Inbound Auth. To integrate authorization with an AWS resource or third-party service, it's necessary to configure both Inbound Auth and Outbound Auth.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just-enough access and secure permission delegation supported by AgentCore Identity, agents can seamlessly and securely access AWS resources and third-party tools such as GitHub, Google, Salesforce, and Slack. Agents can perform actions on these services either on behalf of users or independently, provided there is pre-authorized user consent. Additionally, you can reduce consent fatigue using a secure token vault and create streamlined AI agent experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outbound Authentication Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you register your client application with third-party providers and then create an Outbound Auth. You specify how you want to validate access to the AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway targets. You can use OAuth 2LO/3LO or API keys. With OAuth, you can select from providers that AgentCore Identity provides. In which case you enter the configuration details for the providers from AgentCore Identity. Alternatively, you can supply details for a custom provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a user wants access to an AWS resource or third-party service or AgentCore Gateway target, the Outbound Auth confirms that the access tokens provided by Incoming Auth are valid and if so, allows access to the resource.\n",

    "## OAuth2 Authorization URL Session Binding Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 authorization URL session binding process is a critical security mechanism that ensures OAuth2 authorization sessions are properly associated with authenticated users in AgentCore Identity. This process prevents session hijacking and ensures that OAuth tokens are only granted to the intended user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/oauth2-authorization-url-session-binding.html\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/identity-session-binding.png\" width=\"90%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Invoke agent – Your agent code invokes GetResourceOauth2Token API to retrieve an authorization URL, when an originating agent user wants to access some application or resource that he/she owns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate authorization URL – AgentCore Identity generates an authorization URL and session URI for the user to navigate to and consent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Authorize and obtain access token – The user navigates to the authorization URL and grants consent for your agent to access his/her resource. After that, AgentCore Identity redirects the user's browser to your HTTPS application endpoint with information containing the originating user of the authorization request. At this point, your HTTPS application endpoint determines if the originating agent user is still the same as the currently logged in user of your application. If they match, your application endpoint invokes CompleteResourceTokenAuth so that AgentCore Identity can fetch and store the access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Re-invoke agent to obtain access token – Once the application returns a valid response, your agent application will be able to retrieve the OAuth2.0 access tokens that were originally requested for the user. If the users do not match, your application simply does nothing or logs the attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing your application endpoint to verify the user identity, AgentCore Identity allows your agent application to ensure that it is always the same user who initiated the authorization request and the one who consented access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the OAuth2 Session Binding Flow in this sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 session binding process involves several key steps that coordinate between your application, AgentCore Identity, external OAuth providers (like Google, Github ), and a local callback server:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create Application Callback URL\n",
    "- Create a publicly accessible HTTPS callback endpoint in your application\n",
    "- This endpoint will handle OAuth redirects and validate user sessions\n",
    "- Example: `https://myagentapp.com/callback`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Update Workload Identity with Callback URL\n",
    "- Register your callback URL as an `AllowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrl` in the workload identity\n",
    "- This is accomplished using the `UpdateWorkloadIdentity` API\n",
    "- **In this tutorial**: This step is handled automatically by the code below that updates the workload identity with the local callback server URL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Create OAuth2 Credential Provider\n",
    "- Configure the credential provider with external OAuth provider details (client ID, secret)\n",
    "- AgentCore Identity returns a unique callback URL for the provider\n",
    "- Register this callback URL with the external OAuth provider (e.g., Google Console)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Implement Session Validation and Token Completion\n",
    "- Your callback endpoint must validate the current user's session\n",
    "- Call `CompleteResourceTokenAuth` API with the user identifier and session URI\n",
    "- **In this tutorial**: The `oauth2_callback_server.py` handles this automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: OAuth Flow Execution\n",
    "- User triggers OAuth flow through agent interaction\n",
    "- User is redirected to external provider for authorization\n",
    "- Provider redirects back to your callback with session information\n",
    "- Session binding completes and OAuth tokens become available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Development with oauth2_callback_server.py\n",
    "\n",
    "For local development and testing, this tutorial uses `oauth2_callback_server.py` which:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runs a Local FastAPI Server** (`localhost:9090`)\n",
    "   - Provides `/ping` endpoint for health checks\n",
    "   - Provides `/userIdentifier/token` endpoint to store user tokens\n",
    "   - Provides `/oauth2/callback` endpoint to handle OAuth redirects\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manages User Token Storage**\n",
    "   - Stores the user's JWT token from Cognito authentication\n",
    "   - Associates OAuth sessions with the correct user identity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles OAuth Callback Processing**\n",
    "   - Receives OAuth redirects with `session_id` parameter\n",
    "   - Calls `CompleteResourceTokenAuth` to bind the session\n",
    "   - Validates user identity before completing the flow\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provides Session Security**\n",
    "   - Ensures OAuth sessions are bound to authenticated users\n",
    "   - Prevents unauthorized access to OAuth tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with Workload Identity Update\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet you referenced performs a crucial step in the OAuth2 session binding process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if launch_result.agent_id:\n",
    "    workload_name = launch_result.agent_id\n",
    "    workload_identity = identity_client.get_workload_identity(name=workload_name)\n",
    "    allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls = workload_identity.get(\"allowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrls\") or []\n",
    "    oauth2_callback_url = get_oauth2_callback_url()\n",
    "    print(f\"Updating workload {workload_name} with callback url {oauth2_callback_url}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    updated_workload_identity = identity_client.update_workload_identity(\n",
    "        name=workload_name,\n",
    "        allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls=[*allowed_resource_oauth_2_return_urls, oauth2_callback_url],\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code:\n",
    "1. **Retrieves the Agent's Workload Identity**: Uses the agent ID from the runtime deployment\n",
    "2. **Gets Current Allowed URLs**: Fetches existing `allowedResourceOauth2ReturnUrls`\n",
    "3. **Adds Local Callback URL**: Includes `http://localhost:9090/oauth2/callback` as an allowed return URL\n",
    "4. **Updates Workload Identity**: Registers the callback URL with AgentCore Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "This registration is essential because AgentCore Identity will only redirect OAuth callbacks to pre-registered URLs, providing an additional security layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 session binding process includes several security measures:\n",
    "- **URL Validation**: Only pre-registered callback URLs are allowed\n",
    "- **Session Verification**: User sessions must be validated before token completion\n",
    "- **User Identity Binding**: OAuth sessions are explicitly bound to authenticated users\n",
    "- **Token Isolation**: Each user's OAuth tokens are isolated and secure\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach ensures that OAuth2 flows are secure and properly attributed to the correct users in multi-user environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure the Google OAuth2 credential provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in the current folder copy the following text in it:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=\"\" #\"client id\" recorded from Step 6.1 above\n",
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"\" #\"client secret\" recorded from Step 6.2 above.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the client id and client secret are updated, run the below code to create a credentials provider for Google. <br>\n",
    "Resource credential providers in AgentCore Identity act as intelligent intermediaries that manage the complex relationships between agents, identity providers, and resource servers. Each provider encapsulates the specific endpoint configuration required for a particular service or identity system. The service provides built-in providers for popular services including Google, GitHub, Slack, and Salesforce, with authorization server endpoints and provider-specific parameters pre-configured to reduce development effort. AgentCore Identity supports custom configurations through configurable OAuth2 credential providers that can be tailored to work with any OAuth2-compatible resource server.\n"
